# LUCA: Last Universal Common Ancestor
Evolutionary bio-survival progression shooter warfare saga

LUCA: Last Universal Common Ancestor is a genre-blending evolutionary shooter where you control an experimental organism racing against a world-consuming biological entity. Starting as a single cell, you must rapidly evolve through three distinct survival phases—Evolution, Reproduction, and Final War—each demanding new strategies and mutations. Collect DNA from fallen enemies to unlock real-time mutation choices that permanently reshape your combat abilities, appearance, and interactions with the environment. Experience a continuous adaptation war that blends strategic evolution decisions with intense wave-based combat, where every mutation matters and survival depends on how you evolve.
